In this article, we will show you how to use Service Tool V2000 Exe to reset your Canon printer and fix common problems. Follow these steps carefully and make sure you have a Windows XP computer and a USB cable to connect your printer.
  
## Step 1: Download Service Tool V2000 Exe
  
The first step is to download Service Tool V2000 Exe from a reliable source. You can find it on various websites and forums that offer printer service tools[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. Make sure you scan the file for viruses and malware before opening it. You don't need to install the program; just unzip it and run the executable file.
  
## Step 2: Enter Service Mode
  
The next step is to enter service mode on your Canon printer. Service mode is a special mode that allows you to access the service tool functions. To enter service mode, you need to follow a specific sequence of button presses on your printer. The sequence may vary depending on your printer model and software version[^1^] [^2^], but here is a general procedure that works for most printers:
  
- Turn off your printer by pressing the power button (do not unplug it from the power source).
- Press and hold the stop or resume button (the red triangle) and quickly press and hold the power button (do not release the buttons).
- When the power LED lights up in green, release the stop or resume button but keep holding the power button.
- Press the stop or resume button twice while still holding the power button.
- Release both buttons. The power LED should blink green and the LCD display should show two lines of text: "Service mode" and "Idle".

If you see these messages on your printer screen, you have successfully entered service mode. If not, try again or check your printer manual for the correct procedure.
  
## Step 3: Connect Your Printer to Your Computer
  
Now that your printer is in service mode, you need to connect it to your computer using a USB cable. Make sure you have no other printers connected to your computer. Your computer should detect your printer as a new device. If it asks for drivers, ignore it and do not install any drivers. You only need the service tool program to communicate with your printer.
  
## Step 4: Run Service Tool V2000 Exe
  
The final step is to run Service Tool V2000 Exe on your computer. You should see a window with two tabs: Main and Clear Ink Counter. On the Main tab, you can perform various operations on your printer, such as printing test pages, checking ink levels, reading errors, changing settings, etc[^1^] [^2^]. Be careful not to change any settings that you are not sure about; you may damage your printer or lose important information.
  
To reset your printer and clear the ink absorber error message (which usually appears when the ink absorber is full), go to the Clear Ink Counter tab. Select Main or Platen (depending on which ink absorber you want to reset) from the Absorber drop
